E.g. using an exit code of -1 will result in an actual exit code of 255 being reported.</p><p>On Windows the exit code can be set to any 32-bit value. However some of these values are reserved for reporting system errors like crashes.</p><p>Besides this the Dart executable itself uses an exit code of <code>254</code> for reporting compile time errors and an exit code of <code>255</code> for reporting runtime error (unhandled exception).</p><p>Due to these facts it is recommended to only use exit codes in the range [0..127] for communicating the result of running a Dart program to the surrounding environment.
